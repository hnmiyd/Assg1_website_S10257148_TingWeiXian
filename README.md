Build a website for a band (real or fictional)

My idea is to create a webpage for a music artist(Renforshort) that already has a few tours planned, and has establish a considerable listener base. The artist already hs a couple music audios on platforms such as Youtube, Spotify, Etc. I will have a section for more information about theartist, with several pictures, and I plan to embed spotify music into the website to showcase the Band/singer's work. (artist's youtube videos do not allow embedding.) I will then make a section for the upcoming shows planned and also past shows with pictures too. A merch section will also be added for fan who are interested to buy. LAstly, i will add a section to reach out to the band/singer's socials eg. Instagram, Facebook, Twitter(X), etc.
