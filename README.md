Build a website for a band (real or fictional)

My idea is to create a webpage for a music artist(Renforshort) that already has a few tours planned, and has establish a considerable listener base.
 The artist already hs a couple music audios on platforms such as Youtube, Spotify, Etc. I will have a section for more information about theartist, with several pictures, and I plan to embed spotify music into the website to showcase the Band/singer's work(artist's youtube videos do not allow embedding.)
  
I will then have a section for the upcoming shows planned and also past shows with pictures too.
A merch section will also be added for fan who are interested to buy.
Lastly, i will add a section to reach out to the band/singer's socials eg. Instagram, Facebook, Twitter(X), etc. 

I have added a header with menu, micro-animations and full responsiveness to the website to provide users with a great experience. 

The value that this website provides to users whom are interested fans of the artist is that all the information of the music artist is centralised in this one website with about, music, upcoming shows, merch and contact. The website also serves as a portal for more contacts with the singer and the ability to link users to purchase merchandise from offical sources.
