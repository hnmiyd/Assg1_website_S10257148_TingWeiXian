My idea is to create a webpage for a rising band/singer that already has a few tours planned, and has establish a considerable listener base. The band already hs a couple music audios on platforms such as Youtube, Spotify, Etc. I will have a section for more information about the band/singer, with several pictures, and I plan to embed Youtube videos into the website to showcase the Band/singer's work. I will then make a section for the upcoming shows planned and also past shows with pictures too. LAstly, i will add a section to reach out to the band/singer's socials eg. Instagram, Facebook, Twitter(X), etc.
